## About

During my time at University of Southern California (USC), I worked as a student web developer for the school communications website. Although the website has now changed significantly, I gained business and development experiences during this time. I was gathering requirements from clients, and really understanding what it means to develop for a large audience - which is the school itself. I worked with the communications team mostly, but I also branched out to folks that required business needs that require management software, and also the Viterbi Student Ambassadors (VSA, who needed to showcase what they do.
