## About

When I was a kid, I played a lot of Block puzzle games in my old school gameboy. I always had this inkling for creating video games, and so I tested my skills with re-creating the block puzzle game with web technologies.

The game supports both keyboard and touch controls.

**Keyboard controls**:

- Move Right: Right
- Move Left: Left
- Rotate: Up
- Speed Up Block (Move Down): Down

**Touch Controls / Mouse**:

- Move Right: Swipe Right
- Move Left: Swipe Left
- Rotate: touch center
- Speed Up Block (Move Down): Swipe Down
