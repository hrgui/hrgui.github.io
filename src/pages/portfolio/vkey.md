## About

When I was working as a student web developer at USC, I also had a chance to work on the school's advertising campaign, VKEY. VKEY is the introductory website give to prospective USC Viterbi students to showcase what is possible in USC Viterbi. Here, I learned what it is like to have a client, gathered requirements, and delivered a product to them that they can use and also students can use. VKEY showed the day-to-day lives of Viterbi students, showcased Viterbi professors and their work, and also showed their social life, also had their top places to go to in Los Angeles. Interesting things I used were the Yelp and the Google Maps API; as I integrated those two APIs to provide a rich, interactive experience to get the student's top favorite places to go to.
