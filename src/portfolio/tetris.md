## About
When I was a kid, I played a lot of Tetris in my old school gameboy. I always had this inkling for creating video games, and so I tested my skills with re-creating Tetris with web technologies.  

The game supports both keyboard and touch controls.  
  
**Keyboard controls**:
- Move Right: Right
- Move Left: Left
- Rotate: Up
- Speed Up Block (Move Down): Down
  
**Touch Controls / Mouse**:
- Move Right: Swipe Right
- Move Left: Swipe Left
- Rotate: Swipe Up
- Speed Up Block (Move Down): Swipe Down

### What I Learned
Swiping left and right is not the best user experience for tetris. Will revisit this when discovered a new UX pattern for it and will update to more relevant code.
