excerpt: `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is a useful step in Github Actions. What do I use it for?
---

In 05/09/2022, [Github Actions released `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`](https://github.blog/2022-05-09-supercharging-github-actions-with-job-summaries/).

I use it for reporting code coverage. Writing it in a comment will always fail as comments cannot be greater than 65536 characters. I always exceed that.

Add this step to your Github Actions file:

```yml
- name: ðŸ§ª Test
  run: |
    yarn test --silent --coverage
    echo "### Test Results ðŸ§ª "  >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "\`\`\`"  >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    yarn c8 report >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "\`\`\`"  >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

[Here's a sample result.](https://github.com/hrgui/hrgui.github.io/actions/runs/2613306882)
