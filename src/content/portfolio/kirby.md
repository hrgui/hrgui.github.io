## About

_Kirby_ is one of those lovable characters that is simple to draw. Is it drawable with just CSS?

### What I Learned

Creating Kirby with just CSS3 is not much of a challenge because with `transform`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, it is easy to create. It's because everything can be drawn with circles - and `border-radius` is perfect for that.
